# Welcome to my repository for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Certification projects

Currently, I have **3** FreeCodeCamp certificates:

✨ &nbsp;[FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/andresprza/responsive-web-design)\
✨ &nbsp;[FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and data structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/andresprza/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)\
✨ &nbsp;[FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/andresprza/front-end-development-libraries)

In this repository, you can find the projects for the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/andresprza/responsive-web-design) and [Frontend Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/andresprza/front-end-development-libraries) certificates.\
(JavaScript Algorithms and data structures Certification projects are not included because they are not web apps, just really basic console programs, I could possibly include them in the future, but not today)

On each project, you will find a README with a link to its [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) page.
Most of them are not very polished, but helped me out to improve my coding skills.
